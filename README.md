# chinese_checkers


In this project, I developed a Chinese Checkers simulator using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React, enabling local gameplay on a browser against up to six friends or advanced AI bots. I have also engineered an AI bot with an advanced search algorithm that efficiently analyzes millions of possible moves, resulting in a significantly challenging opponent. The inspiration behind this project was to create a Chinese Checkers browser game with higher difficulty bots compared to other local Chinese Checkers games on the internet. Note that the current build works best on a computer browser.
